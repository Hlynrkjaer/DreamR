üè† **f√∏rstedag**|Pretty interesting tasks. But some of them with unclear reasoned view. |
----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|

My own large stack was with "Key Validation Service Two". In general, based on my too small experience with JavaScript, Webpack and debugging such things.
It was clear where is 'flag'. But it was unclear how to 'calculate' (receive, find, decrypt, capture) it. And what if there are any other connections with something more than JavaScript. 

Also, Internet Explorer 11 (Windows 10) is not supported. Microsoft Edge was with not enough view under browser's console (I downloaded important .js-file manually). First try with expected place and another browser was with unexpected result. Just because it was not enough clear for me that indeed I have to think about it directly (and not about something else like studying webpack, chunks, other places or tricks) - I switched to another fields. After six hours - I back to expected place and start to try understand what is it (manually). So, even if it was possible to use browser's console for kind of 'compute' it. I did manual steps for recovering flag. Take quite count of time. Then double check that it was possible to calculate briefly and I found that my first try was with 'unintended' payload (and, as result, broken output).
All other tasks are pretty common and interesting ones. At least, for logical sorting. Exception with RSA calculation - based on something first tries to calculate was with huge delay about proper result. Decided to find good enough tool for such calculation. And result is received briefly (as expected for such task).

üå≤ **andendag**|Much more strange reasoned tasks, but with interesting scale. |
---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|

In general, tasks with large scale of its design. While most of them was sorted pretty briefly - my own experience was with three stucks.
Where two stucks was with unclear 'expected' flag-view state. I tried multiple valid steps - but switch to find something else or re-tweak solution. It take some unwanted hours (as result). And third stuck is still delayed; it is third "Key validation service". Task with clear design and what we are supposed to do. Also, with potentially visible steps to do so - but based on my too small experience with JavaScript, browser's console debugging and things around (not really enjoy to play with it) - I switched from this task to next day (because one of previously noted stucks was with enough delay for situation that there are released already and, as result, locked third day; so, with sort-step for 'second' stuck - I switch to next available tasks).

Also, I am not sure about such JavaScript(?) tasks. It is not pinned to course itself. And maybe it is interesting one but too much specific. For example, "hemmeligmalingr" tasks are tricky too (of course) - but with certain tools - less time needed. Even my noted 'second' stuck was about manual extracting and playing with such for doublecheck (while with tools - it should take some minutes only).
With JavaScript tasks - I am not so friendly with most of 'related' fields. Just like if someone else with [Fj√∂lnir](https://is.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fj%C3%B6lnir_(forritunarm%C3%A1l)). But maybe debug/learn task about 'something' written on Fj√∂lnir is more interesting than "Key Validation Services Three/Four" (and even "Two").

üöâ **tredjedag**|In general, sorted speedy than two others. |
----------------|-------------------------------|

After sorting latest task for unlock fresh tasks - all of them was released. So, less then thirty minutes and there are only "Key Validation Service Four" and "secret_c" are unsorted. First one is postponed for futher play with it (as previous Key Validation Service too). And with "secret_c" - I tried to check and play statically. With some potential steps and checking information.
Even if it with some results - based on my too much small experience (too much) with kind of executables-debug and Linux - I delayed further play for installing Linux 64bit and potential debug it directly (dynamically). Or so on.
